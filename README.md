# lc_hr_cw
Leetcode, Hackerrank, and Codewars challenges with solutions and a diverse collection of visual aids, cheatsheets and other learning methods to help make sense of it all!!! Got something you'd like to add??? This is a collaborative effort!!! Please visit this repo and read the instructions on the correct way to contribute to open source projects: [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).

## Description
We aim to please users with NOT just another solution bank to leetcode problems, but MORE. Contributors are encouraged to upload and share any additional content such as visual diagrams, animated GIFs, notes, charts, or whatever they use to not only solve, but UNDERSTAND the problem at hand. 

## Examples of Supplementary Learning Materials

An example of [Python Tutor](www.pythontutor.com) doing what it does best:

I use <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/" style="color:#d35400; font-weight:900">app.diagrams.net</a> to make these charts... its a <span style="color:#32cd32; font-weight:900">FREE</span> google=doc-compatible diagram creator:

## Why join the team?
Well, we all know that there are countless resources for basically any topic in web development out there. So no, this is NOT just another resource that regurgitates info and slaps their logo on it. This is an effort to not only provide solutions to `Data Structures and Algorithms` problems, but to take each one a step or two further by including easy follow, broken down explanations of each step with the mindset that we are teaching coding to a toddler! 

Here are some ways you can get your contributions up and become an asset to the tech industry!!! 

1. List your name and info in the table below. THATS IT. Do that using the guidelines in the link above and you are a contributor!!!!!
2. Improve existing code (please leave original files untouched and add "-updated" to the end of your new filename (if you update `twoSum.js`, create your own file called `twoSum-updated.js`)
3. Answer any missing problem from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/), or [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) and place the file in its own folder in the corresponding directory following the format already being used with previous submissions.
4. Improve or add READMEs to each sub-directory. 
5. Request to gain admin privileges and help manage the project by helping with checking the PRs and moderating and maintaining the repo.
6. ANYTHING you can muster up or would like to suggest! We are always open to new ideas!!!

Thank you in advance!
